        <p>This website is a place to learn Modern Greek made by Maggie and Martin.
           Those are our faces.</p>

        <p>Maggie is a real Greek person, with natively-fluent English abilities, and Martin
           has spent hundreds of hours learning the weird intricacies of Greek and other
           languages.</p>

        <p>During his studying he was frustrated by the lack of Modern Greek resources, so
           decided that he should rope Maggie into helping make his own.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re interested in learning other languages too! If you want to do a language
           swap for English or Greek, or chat to us in general,
           <a href="mailto:martinallison@gmail.com">send us an email</a>.</p>
