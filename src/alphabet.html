        <p class="emoji-heading">Ω 🍝 Ω</p>

        <p>The most obvious thing about Greek is that it uses a different alphabet. Whereas
            English uses the Latin alphabet, Greek uses… well, the Greek one. Learning it is the
            gateway to reading and speaking Greek.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The Greek alphabet has only 24 letters. Here they are, upper- and lowercase, in order:</p>

        <figure class="alphabet bordered shadowed v-margin-m v-padding-m">
            <p>Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ζ Η Θ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ Ω</p>
            <p>α β γ δ ε ζ η θ ι κ λ μ ν ξ ο π ρ σ,ς τ υ φ χ ψ ω</p>
        </figure>

        <p>At first it might look confusing, but some of the letters are probably recognisable
            already.</p>

        <p>Some look the same as their English (Latin) counterparts, some you might recognise if
            you do maths or science things, and some you’ve probably seen being misused on
            Greek-style yoghurt packaging.</p>

        <p>Others look more mysterious: what on earth is a Ξ, or a Ψ? Well, we’ll demystify them
            and the rest of the letters of the alphabet in small groups.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>α ε κ μ τ</h2>

        <p>Let’s start with the easy letters. These are letters that look (their uppercase
            forms at least) and sound like their English ‘equivalents’. Listen to Maggie say
            the basic pronunciation and name for each letter below.</p>

        <table class="centered v-margin-m">
            {{ macros.pronunciation_table(alphabet.group_1) }}
        </table>

        <p>With just these five letters, you can already say some Greek words!</p>

        <figure class="examples">
            {% for example in alphabet.examples_1 %}
                {{ macros.example(
                    example.greek,
                    example.romanisation,
                    example.meaning,
                    audio=example.audio) }}
            {% endfor %}
        </figure>
        
        <p>(In general don’t worry about trying to remember the the example words right now.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>β ζ ι λ ο</h2>

        <table class="centered v-margin-m">
            {{ macros.pronunciation_table(alphabet.group_2) }}
        </table>

        <p>With these and the previous letters combined, you can now read around 1000 Greek
            words, including:</p>

        <figure class="examples">
            {% for example in alphabet.examples_2 %}
                {{ macros.example(
                    example.greek,
                    example.romanisation,
                    example.meaning,
                    audio=example.audio) }}
            {% endfor %}
        </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>δ ν π σ ω</h2>

        <table class="centered v-margin-m">
            {{ macros.pronunciation_table(alphabet.group_3) }}
        </table>

        <p>Notice <i>σίγμα</i> has two lowercase letters: ⟨σ, ς⟩. The only difference is
            that ⟨ς⟩ is used in place of ⟨σ⟩ as the last letter in a word. E.g.:
            <i>καλό<strong>ς</strong></i> instead of <i>καλό<strong>σ</strong></i>,
            <i>πω<strong>ς</strong></i> instead of <i>πω<strong>σ</strong></i>, etc.</p>

        <p>Many Greek first-person verb forms end in ⟨ω⟩, so whenever you want to say that you do
            (or don’t do) something, you’ll be using this letter (which is quite a lot of the
            time) and so knowing it unlocks the ability to use Greek verbs:</p>

        <figure class="examples">
            {% for example in alphabet.examples_3 %}
                {{ macros.example(
                    example.greek,
                    example.romanisation,
                    example.meaning,
                    audio=example.audio) }}
            {% endfor %}
        </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>η θ φ υ</h2>

        <table class="centered v-margin-m">
            {{ macros.pronunciation_table(alphabet.group_4) }}
        </table>

        <p>Now we’ve seen all seven vowels, notice that three make the exact same ‘ee’ sound:
            ⟨η, ι, υ⟩ and two the exact same ‘o’ sound: ⟨ο, ω⟩.</p>

        <figure class="examples">
            {% for example in alphabet.examples_4 %}
                {{ macros.example(
                    example.greek,
                    example.romanisation,
                    example.meaning,
                    audio=example.audio) }}
            {% endfor %}
        </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>γ ξ ρ χ ψ</h3>

        <p>The last and trickiest group has some sounds that are a little difficult for English
            speakers to pronounce—especially those of ⟨γ, χ⟩.</p>

        <table class="centered v-margin-m">
            {{ macros.pronunciation_table(alphabet.group_5) }}
        </table>

        <p><i>Γάμμα</i> (⟨γ⟩) and <i>χι</i> (⟨χ⟩) are hard for English speakers to pronounce.
            If you’re finding it tricky, you can approximate ⟨γ⟩ with a normal ‘g’, and
            ⟨χ⟩ with an ‘h’ sound.</p>

        <p>There are a few other pronunciation details for ⟨γ, χ⟩ (and ⟨κ⟩ too), but even with
            just the basic pronunciation you can have a go at saying a great deal of Greek
            words. Some final ones to add to the list:</p>

        <figure class="examples">
            {% for example in alphabet.examples_5 %}
                {{ macros.example(
                    example.greek,
                    example.romanisation,
                    example.meaning,
                    audio=example.audio)
                }}

        <h2>Done</h2>

        <p>Hopefully the strange letters now seem less mysterious: they mostly just represent
            sounds that already exist in English.</p>

        <p>After some practice you’ll be able to recognise them, and disassociate them from
            letters they might look like in English. At some point when you look at a Greek word,
            it’ll just be <em>Greek</em>.</p>

        <p>Until then, here’s a summary of things it’s useful to remember while practicing:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>⟨β⟩ is ‘v’</strong>, not ‘b’</li>
                <li><strong>⟨ν⟩ is ‘n’</strong>, not ‘v’</li>
                <li><strong>⟨ω⟩ is ‘o’</strong>, not ‘w’</li>
                <li>⟨ς⟩ is used instead of ⟨σ⟩ if it’s the last letter in a word</li>
                <li>⟨ω⟩ is a very common verb ending</li>
                <li><strong>⟨η⟩ is ‘ee’</strong>, not ‘h’ or ‘n’</li>
                <li><strong>⟨υ⟩ is ‘ee’</strong>, not ‘u’ or ‘y’</li>
                <li>If you struggle with pronouncing ⟨γ⟩, use ‘g’</li>
                <li>If you struggle with pronouncing ⟨χ⟩, use ‘h’</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>You might have noticed that there are no Greek letters for ‘b‘, ‘d’ or hard ‘g’ sounds
            (among others). In the next guide, we’ll see how Greek uses two-letter combinations
            to make those (and other) sounds.</p>
