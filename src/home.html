        <h1>Learn Greek!</h1>

        <p class="emoji">🇬🇷 🔱 💃🏻 ☀️ 🛥️</p>

        <p>Hello! Welcome to Greek guides: a bunch of small, concise guides to learning the
            Modern Greek language.</p>

        <p>It’s not a language people typically learn (and there are only 13ish million speakers),
            so there’s not much out there for people wanting to give it a go, either for
            holidaying, because of a Greek partner, or just because it sounds and looks nice.</p>

        <p>That’s why <a href="{{ url('/about') }}">we</a>, Maggie (a native Greek) and Martin
            (someone who's learning Greek), decided to put these guides together. We're not
            linguists, so each guide is simple and practical rather than 100% linguistically
            technically accurate.</p>

        <p>We hope you like them! Give us feedback or ask us questions
            <a href="mailto:martinallison@gmail.com">here</a>.</p>
