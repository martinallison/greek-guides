    It’s the language spoken by 10-12 million people across the world, but
    mainly in Greece, Cyprus and parts of Albania.

  <p>
    There are big Greek-speaking communities in parts of the US, Germany and
    London too. If you can walk around central London for a day without hearing
    Greek at least once, we’ll buy you a gyro (<el>γύρο</el>).

  <h2>Why would I want to learn it?</h2>

  <p>
    The Greek language has one of the longest histories of any language on the
    planet. People have been speaking some form of Greek for over three
    <em>thousand</em> years.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Its ancient form was used by the some of the first truly sophisticated
    philosophers, mathematicians and physicists who gave us the foundations
    for much of what we understand about the world today. That’s crazy.
  <p>

  <p>
    If that doesn’t do it for you, maybe you’ve got a Greek partner (or maybe
    you’re looking for one...), Greek friends or Greek heritage. Perhaps
    Greece is your go-to place for a holiday and you finally want to be able
    to say thanks after ordering that souvlaki (<el>σουβλάκι</el>).
