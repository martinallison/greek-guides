    It’s the language spoken by 10-12 million people across the world, but
    mainly in Greece, Cyprus and parts of Albania.

    There are big Greek-speaking communities in parts of the US, Germany and
    London too. If you can walk around central London for a day without hearing
    Greek at least once, we’ll buy you a gyro (<el>γύρο</el>).

  <h2>Why would I want to learn it?</h2>

  <p>Probably one of two reasons:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Because Greek language and culture has one of the longest histories on
        the planet, the language being one of the first to be used to express
        ideas about philosophy, astronomy, maths and physics, or
      </li>
      <li>
        So you can read trashy news articles about <a href="https://newsbomb.gr">whatever</a>
        <a href="https://newsbomb.gr">Ronaldo’s</a> <a href="https://newsbomb.gr">doing</a>
        <a href="https://newsbomb.gr">lately</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    But seriously, people have been speaking some form of Greek for over three
    <em>thousand</em> years. That’s absolutely insane.
  </p>

  <p>
    Failing that, maybe you’ve got a Greek partner (or you’re looking for one...),
    Greek friends you want to swear at, or Greek heritage. Or, you’d just like
    to be able to say thanks after ordering a souvlaki (<el>σουβλάκι</el>) on
    holiday.
