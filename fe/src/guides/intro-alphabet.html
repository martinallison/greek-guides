  <h2>So... is Modern Greek the same as Ancient Greek?</h2>

  <p>
    Nope. Modern Greek has much easier pronunciation and grammar. The two
    look similar when written down, but Greeks normally can’t understand much
    without studying it.

  <h2>It’s easier? But the letters still look different</h2>

  <p>
    Yeah, Greek doesn’t use the same alphabet as English (the Latin alphabet):
    it uses the ...Greek one:
  </p>

  <el-alphabet class="margin-v-m"/>

  <p>
    Some of them don’t look <em>that</em> different. On the other hand there’s
    stuff like <el>ψ</el> and <el>ξ</el> which can surely only exist to confuse
    and baffle.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The good news is that, unlike English, there are no hidden sounds, silent
    Ks or other nonsense. Most letters only have one pronunciation (there
    are only three exceptions) so once you learn each one you can pronounce
    pretty much any Greek word!

  <h2>What does it sound like then?</h2>

  <p>
    Since it’s basically unrelated to any other modern languages, Greek’s
    got quite a distinct sound. Greek spoken quickly by a native is an
    amazing thing.

    Here are some example Greek tongue twisters:

    <div class="margin-v-m">
      <el en="Bright white rock, and yet brighter from the sun">
        Άσπρη πέτρα ξέξασπρη, κι απ’τον ήλιο ξεξασπρότερη
      </el>
    </div>

    <div class="margin-v-m">
      <el en="A duck, but which duck? A duck with ducklings">
        Μία πάπια, μα ποιά πάπια; Μια πάπια με παπιά
      </el>
    </div>

    <div class="margin-v-m">
      <el en="A tiger with three cubs">
        Μια τίγρη με τρία τιγράκια
      </el>
    </div>
